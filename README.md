## Installation

No deps, clean nodejs.

```bash
npm install coinpayments
```

<a name="setup" />

## Setup

- Create an account on [www.coinpayments.net](https://www.coinpayments.net/index.php?ref=831b8d495071e5b0e1015486f5001150)
- Go to **My Account -> Coin Acceptance Settings**
- Check the coins you wish to accept.
  - You can setup your payment address, so you can use coinpayments as a pass thru service, rather then a cloud wallet (Payout mode ASAP/Nightly).
  - **Payout Made** (To Balance/ASAP/Nightly)
    - **To Balance:** Received payments are stored in your account for later withdrawal at your leisure.
    - **ASAP:** Received payments are sent to the address you specify as soon as they are received and confirmed.
    - **Nightly:** Received payments are grouped together and sent daily (at approx. midnight EST GMT -0500). The main benefit of this options is it will save you coin TX fees
  - **Discount (%)**
    - **Positive Numbers:** Gives buyers a discount for paying with a coin. Good promotional tool if you want to give extra support to a particular coin.
    - **Negative Numbers:** Adds a certain percentage for paying with a coin. This could be used to cover your crypto/fiat conversation costs, make adjustments to match your local exchange, etc.
- Go to **My Account -> API Keys** , generate API key pair
- **Edit permissions** on the generated **API KEY** and enable all options
- Get some Litecoin testnet coins [here](https://www.coinpayments.net/help-testnet)

## Local development

Payment notifications are not available for local development. However, there is a feature which is outside of scope of this module.
Most Coinpayment buttons [(Frontend form submissions)](https://www.coinpayments.net/merchant-tools-simple) have a bunch of handy parameters. Most handy would be: `success_url`, `cancel_url`.
Like most eCommerce systems, there are usually two endpoints, one for callback URL ( client triggered ) and POST notifications ( payment processor confirmations ). Preferably on local development, using forms requests should be enought, however staging/production environments should include notifications.

## Instant payment notifications

This is a separate npm package.
